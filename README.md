## üéØ Project Overview

This project introduces an intelligent fault detection system for motorcycles that leverages machine learning techniques on engine acoustic signals, enabling non-intrusive and efficient diagnosis. The system captures audio signals from a running motorcycle and processes them using advanced audio feature extraction techniques to accurately classify engine conditions and detect potential faults.
